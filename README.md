# Jammming
## Introduction
The goal of this project was to create and deploy a react app, practice many intricacies of react development, style each individual component, and use an API (Spotify) to populate app components. The user enters a song as a search item and clicks search. Then the user may be prompted to login to their Spotify account. Upon loggin in, the user is redirected to the jammming app. If the user is already logged in, the user can search for a song and add one or more songs from the search results to a new playlist. The user can also rename the playlist to be created and remove songs from playlist. When the user is satisfied with their playlist, they can click save playlist to upload the new playlist to their Spotify.
